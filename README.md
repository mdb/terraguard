# terraguard

`terraguard` checks a [Terraform](https://terraform.io) plan for planned changes to specific resources.

## Disclaimer

Tools like [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) and [its Terraform policy capabilities](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/terraform/) arguably offer more robust, extendable, and fully featured means of enforcing Terraform policies. `terraguard` is a simple alternative, though is far less mature.
